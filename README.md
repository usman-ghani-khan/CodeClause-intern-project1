# Customer Purchase Clustering and Sentiment Analysis

## Aim
Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior and use NLP techniques to preprocess text data and build a sentiment analysis model.

## Description
This project involves:
1. Segmenting customers using K-Means clustering based on purchase behavior data.
2. Preprocessing text data using NLP techniques and building a sentiment analysis model.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK or SpaCy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## What I Learned
- Text preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Sentiment analysis
- Clustering algorithms (K-Means)

## Introduction
This project segments customers based on their purchase behavior using K-Means clustering and performs sentiment analysis on text data using NLP techniques.

## Dataset
### Clustering Data
The dataset includes customer purchase behavior with features such as:
- Total Purchase Amount
- Purchase Frequency
- Average Purchase Value
- Days Since Last Purchase
- Product Categories
- Total Items Purchased
- Average Items Per Purchase
- Returns Count

### Sentiment Analysis Data
A separate text dataset for building and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.
